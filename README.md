# dotfiles

# Install git

`xcode-select --install`

# Clone the repository

```sh
mkdir ~/Documents/projects
cd ~/Documents/projects
# TODO: git clone git@github.com:santiagohervella/dotfiles.git
git clone https://github.com/santiagohervella/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

# Install ansible

```sh
./install
```

## Add ansible and homebrew to PATH

Ansible and it's goodies get installed inside Python's bin directory. PATH will get set up with `.zshrc` once we run the playbook. We just need to add Python's bin to the PATH for our current session so that we can call `ansible`.

Same deal with homebrew.

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
```

# Configure playbook

Change the `machine_type` variable in `./default.config.yml` to be 'personal' or 'work'

# Run playbook

```sh
# Set up macOS
# Do not run this command inside of tmux as it makes something go wonky
ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-become-pass
```

# Remaining manual steps

# In case you completely forget how any of this works

I found [this post](https://phelipetls.github.io/posts/introduction-to-ansible/) a bit too late after I'd already done tons of reading / learning on Ansible, but if you forget everything it would make for a great refresher!

This repo is set up to use Ansible to manage a macOS machine. This includes system settings, apps and packages with homebrew, and your dev environment using neovim.

I'll try to roughly walk you through the flow.

- The first `xcode-select --install` command does a few things, but most importantly, it installs `git`
- Cloning this repo locally is self-explanatory

#### Running the ./install script

TODO: Write this explanation

# TODOs

## Done but needs to be tested

- Bartender / menu bar spacing

## Required

## Improvements

- Cargo + bob for managing nvim versions
- Maybe make the kdiff3 config symlinking an ansible task rather than doing it in the `.macos.sh` script
- Caps Lock -> Control could be done through Karabiner instead of System Settings to remove one manual step
- Try kdiff3's 3 way merge and if so, set is as the merge tool in the git config like this:
  `https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig#L21`
- Explore zsh's vi mode
- Try out the [DeskPad utility app](https://github.com/Stengo/DeskPad) for better screen sharing on video calls
  - Here's a good [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-as2_bud9s) of what it does
- Maybe try out [Folke's desktop wallpaper](https://github.com/folke/dot/blob/master/config/wall.png)?

### Neovim

#### Ideas

- Breakpoints, DAP
  - Omerxx video, [DEBUG in Neovim. Like a BOSS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RziPWdTzSV8)
- LLMs?
  - Avante for nvim? Check out these links:
    - [AI in Neovim (NeovimConf 2024)](https://www.joshmedeski.com/posts/ai-in-neovim-neovimconf-2024/)
    - [Get the Cursor AI experience in Neovim with avante nvim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kzSV2xctjc)
    - [avante.nvim](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim)
  - Similarly, properly set up [CopilotChat](https://github.com/CopilotC-Nvim/CopilotChat.nvim)
    - [This](https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/nvim-config/blob/main/lua/noobscience/plugins/copilotchat.lua) could be a good setup to reference that I found by searching GitHub
- New Neovim config has a bunch of quirks that are not fun. Try to figure those out...
  - The LSP diagnostics don't always refresh upon exiting insert mode. Hard to reproduce so I'll just have to be on the lookout for this
- Maybe set look into Obsidian plugins or general note taking improvements
  - Omerxx's video [The Holy Grail of Neovim Note Taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ht8NYkU9wQ)
  - Linkarzu's recent videos on the subject
    - [How I Recreated (and Improved) My Obsidian Note-Taking Workflow in Neovim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_g8q5JeisY)
    - [My complete Neovim markdown setup and workflow in 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YEbKDlxfss)
  - [markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim) to preview markdown in the browser and have the position of the page synced to the editor
- Maybe check out [lsp-timeout.nvim](https://github.com/hinell/lsp-timeout.nvim/tree/main) to kill LSP servers after a certain amount of time
- I don't really think I need this one, but before deciding on that, I should do a bit of research while I'm working to see if there are tons of leftover language servers all the time

#### To read or watch

- Check out some of the talks linked in [the readme](https://github.com/preservim/vim-pencil) of the vim-pencil plugin
- Read the entirety of [this famous vim stackoverflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118)

### Terminal Emulators

- Do try to recreate your iTerm2 config in WezTerm. I really like that it's in lua
  - Here's [Folke's WezTerm config](https://github.com/folke/dot/blob/master/config/wezterm/wezterm.lua) as a reference

### Hammerspoon

- Maybe set up Omerxx's [GoMaCal Hammerspoon thing](https://github.com/omerxx/GoMaCal) to get calendar messages in your face?
  - Here is how he uses it in his [`init.lua`](https://github.com/omerxx/dotfiles/blob/master/hammerspoon/init.lua#L21)
