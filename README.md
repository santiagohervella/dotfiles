# dotfiles

# Install git

`xcode-select --install`

# Clone the repository

```sh
mkdir ~/Documents/projects
cd ~/Documents/projects
# TODO: git clone git@github.com:santiagohervella/dotfiles.git
git clone https://github.com/santiagohervella/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles

# Install ansible

```sh
./install
```

## Add ansible and homebrew to PATH

Ansible and it's goodies get installed inside Python's bin directory. PATH will get set up with `.zshrc` once we run the playbook. We just need to add Python's bin to the PATH for our current session so that we can call `ansible`.

Same deal with homebrew.

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
```

# Configure playbook

Change the `machine_type` variable in `./default.config.yml` to be 'personal' or 'work'

# Run playbook

```sh
# Set up macOS
ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-become-pass
```

# Remaining manual steps

## On all Macs

- Set screen resolution. This could probably be done with a script, but since each machine is different, let's keep it manual
- Set up TouchID if on a MacBook
- Sign into 1Password
- Sign into iCloud
- Raycast
  - Set up Raycast settings by navigating to `~/.config/raycast/` and double clicking on the latest `.rayconfig` file

# In case you completely forget how any of this works

I found [this post](https://phelipetls.github.io/posts/introduction-to-ansible/) a bit too late after I'd already done tons of reading / learning on Ansible, but if you forget everything it would make for a great refresher!

This repo is set up to use Ansible to manage a macOS machine. This includes system settings, apps and packages with homebrew, and your dev environment using neovim.

I'll try to roughly walk you through the flow.

- The first `xcode-select --install` command does a few things, but most importantly, it installs `git`
- Cloning this repo locally is self-explanatory

#### Running the ./install script

TODO: Write this explanation

# TODOs

## Done but needs to be tested

- Bartender / menu bar spacing
  - Still needs work arrangement plist file brought into the repo

## Required

## Improvements

- Superchange keyboard shortcuts
- Cargo + bob for managing nvim versions
- Maybe make the kdiff3 config symlinking an ansible task rather than doing it in the `.macos.sh` script
- Caps Lock -> Control could be done through Karabiner instead of System Settings to remove one manual step
- Try kdiff3's 3 way merge and if so, set is as the merge tool in the git config like this:
  `https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig#L21`

  - [avante.nvim](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim)
- New Neovim config has a bunch of quirks that are not fun. Try to figure those out...
  - I don't love how the folkse todo plugin highlights things. I keep hitting my keymap to disable highlighting, but I otherwise like the plugin
- Explore zsh's vi mode
