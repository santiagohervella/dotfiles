# dotfiles

# Install git

`xcode-select --install`

# Clone the repository

```sh
mkdir ~/Documents/projects
cd ~/Documents/projects
# TODO: git clone git@github.com:santiagohervella/dotfiles.git
git clone https://github.com/santiagohervella/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

# Install ansible

```sh
./install
```

## Add ansible and homebrew to PATH

Ansible and it's goodies get installed inside Python's bin directory. PATH will get set up with `.zshrc` once we run the playbook. We just need to add Python's bin to the PATH for our current session so that we can call `ansible`.

Same deal with homebrew.

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
```

# Configure playbook

Change the `machine_type` variable in `./default.config.yml` to be 'personal' or 'work'

# Run playbook

```sh
# Set up macOS
ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-become-pass
```

- TODO

# In case you completely forget how any of this works

This repo is set up to use Ansible to manage a macOS machine. This includes system settings, apps and packages with homebrew, and your dev environment using neovim.

I'll try to roughly walk you through the flow.

- The first `xcode-select --install` command does a few things, but most importantly, it installs `git`
- Cloning this repo locally is self-explanatory

#### Running the ./install script
